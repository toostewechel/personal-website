## I'm so busy

How often have you tried to remember something important after a busy day and felt it slip through your mental grasp? This question might seem familiar to you if you are a knowledge worker. Nowadays, knowledge workers experience an endless onslaught of demands on their time where their innate curiosity and imagination wither away under the weight of obligations. We are surrounded by knowledge yet starving for wisdom.

Research indicates that knowledge workers spend a great deal of their time - _an average of 40%_ - looking for information and discretionary activities that offer little personal satisfaction. As a result, we instinctively devote time to tedious, non-value-added activities that make us feel busy and thus important. At the same time, organisations constantly strive to do more with less and pile on as many responsibilities as knowledge workers are willing to accept. As a result, many workers report historic levels of stress, distraction and hours logged, even resulting in a global trend called [The Great Resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation).

## Knowledge is power

In its essence, no matter what our formal role is, knowledge work is about having to come up with new ideas, solve novel problems and communicate with each other effectively. Information is a fundamental building block in this creative process. Besides, anything you might want to accomplish in your personal and professional life requires finding and putting the correct information to use. Yet, in today's digital age, where information is more accessible than ever, we are paralysed with indecision on where to focus our attention. We consume the equivalent of 174 full newspapers of content daily, which is five times higher than in 1986. 

Information overload heavily taxes our mental resources and leaves us constantly anxious that we will forget something. Busyness _is_ a real problem, slowly seeping into leisure time. I personally noticed it firsthand in my daily life as I was increasingly overwhelmed with a constant flood of information. Like most people, I applied all the well-known productivity hacks such as [Inbox Zero](https://blog.superhuman.com/inbox-zero-method/), [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/eisenhower-matrix/#:~:text=The%20Eisenhower%20Matrix%20is%20a,to%20their%20urgency%20and%20importance.) and[ Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/). However, I still felt I was mentally juggling all the different pieces, unable to create and get critical work done efficiently. 

So, I began researching personal knowledge management more intensively. I found that the problem isn't with the intrinsic logic of these approaches but that they don't work at the system level. Statistician and management consultant W. Edwards Deming [argues](https://deming.org/appreciation-for-a-system/) that 94% of most problems and improvements belong to the system, not the individual. So to make a real impact, we might need an integrated system to organize and unlock our creative potential rather than isolated methods and tools. 

## Get things out of your head

The nature of work is changing rapidly: job hopping, outsourcing and automation and large mergers and acquisitions. We can now expect to spend only a few months to a few years with one organisation. These constant transitions mean our ability to capture, organise and retrieve our ideas and apply and transfer them effectively from project to project and company to company becomes more important than ever. In this fast-paced world, increasingly driven by innovation and creativity, not having a personal knowledge management (PKM) system means you are not fully leveraging what you learn. You are not collecting your ideas and making valuable connections between them.

The purpose of a PKM system is to allow us to be more creative and spontaneous or, as David Allen puts it: _“... a system for getting things out of your head and into objective, reviewable format”_. This system helps open up your conscious mind to focus on creating novel value. Creating such a system is a design problem. And like all design problems, it must balance and trade-off multiple priorities against each other: the balance between order and uncertainty; between being goal-directed and allowing our thinking to lead us to unexpected places; between supporting our existing viewpoints and challenging us with new ones. It can help us cultivate an Opposable Mind - the ability to hold two opposing ideas in our mind simultaneously - without taxing our ability to get things done. 

However, as nice as this sounds, the journey starts with a frictionless and practical system you can use to get things going as such a system will likely serve a lifetime and needs to adapt to your changing needs over time. So, before improving your system, you have to make it work because you will resist the whole process if your system is not fast, functional and fun to use. 

## There is no 'right' way

When you explore the world of PKM, you quickly discover many ways to build such a system. There is much information, specialised software tools to choose from and many opposing views of domain experts on the implementation. However, it is essential to keep the end in mind as no matter which system you use; it has to serve you and not the other way around. There are no one-size fits all methods or apps as everyone lives in different environments and works and operates under other circumstances.

After exploring multiple options, I settled on the book Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte to be a helpful self-help guide in my journey to build my PKM system. That's because it emphasises information management as a mindset rather than a toolset: the shift in mindset from scarcity to abundance, from obligation to service, and finally, from consuming to creating. As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource. The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. Tiago Forte forces you to rethink your relationship with information and its relation to your attention and energy.

## The Four Big Ideas

The Second Brain is a collection of techniques and tools you can mix and match. These will help you create a trusted place outside your head where you can collect, connect and organise your most important ideas and insights - _while filtering out the junk_ - and use them to do your best work. A Second Brain is one searchable, accessible, easily shared private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It has four essential capabilities that it performs for us; making our ideas concrete, revealing new associations between concepts, incubating our ideas over time and sharpening our unique perspective. The four big ideas are:

#### Everything can be a Knowledge Asset
In the digital world, knowledge is scattered over different mediums and formats such as screenshots, articles, podcasts or other media. These so-called "Knowledge Assets" crystallise what you know in concrete form. You can use them in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept or learn from an experience. Knowledge assets can come from the external world or your inner thoughts and are the fundamental building blocks of your Second Brain.

#### Capture, Organise, Distill, Express
Tiago Forte introduces the capture, organise, distil, express (CODE) method as a four-step approach to remembering what matters. Each step represents a timeless principle and is flexible and agnostic for any profession, role, or career and for whatever note-taking methods and platforms you prefer. In essence, CODE provides a map for navigating the endless stream of information coming your way every day.

#### Being organised is a habit
We are used to organisational systems that are static and fixed. We expect to find a strict set of rules that tells us exactly where each item goes. However, when it comes to our knowledge, there is no such assigned spot. We are organising for actionability, and what's actionable is constantly changing. The PARA System is one of the methods to organise your Second Brain. Being organised is a habit - a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with and put the information to use. The two habits most important to your Second Brain are project checklists and weekly and monthly reviews. 

#### Standardise the way you work
Building a Second Brain is about standardising how we work because we only improve when we standardise how we do something. Through the simple acts of capturing ideas, organising them into groups, distilling the best parts, and assembling them to create value for others, we are practising the basic moves of knowledge work in such a way that we can improve on them over time. Moreover, the products of creativity are constantly changing, and there is always a new 'hot' trend to run after, but if you go one level deeper, the process of creativity is the same as it was thousands of years ago.
